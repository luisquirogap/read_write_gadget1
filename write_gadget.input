# The first line is the name of a file in ascii with data to bulid the type 1 gadget file
# the order of the ascii data blocks should be equal to the types of particles of gadget
# 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 , the columns should be correspond to:

# id x y z vx vy vz mass internal_energy for type 0
# id x y z vx vy vz mass for other types

# The rest of number correspond to the quantities that fill the header for a snapshot of gadget
# with the follow data structure:
 
#  int Npart[6];
#  double mass[6];
#  double time;
#  double   redshift;
#  int      flag_sfr;
#  int      flag_feedback;
#  unsigned int npartTotal[6];
#  int      flag_cooling;
#  int      num_files;
#  double   BoxSize;
#  double   Omega0;
#  double   OmegaLambda;
#  double   HubbleParam; 
#  int flag_stellarage;
#  int flag_metals;
#  unsigned int npartTotalHighWord[6];
#  int  flag_entropy_instead_u;
#  char     fill[256 - 6*4 - 6*8 - 2*8 - 2*4 - 6*4 - 2*4 - 4*8 - 2*4 - 6*4 - 1*4];  /* fills to 256 Bytes */

# If some component of header vector mass is different to zero, the column of mass for that type 
# of particle should not be in ascii data, see gadget user guide for more clearity of this and the other
# information. 

# If the user wants that the mass per particle of any component is the same for all, the column of masses
# should be fill of zeros, but the its component in the masses vector should be major than zero.
